# BrainF-Examples
Learning brainf*** one day at a time.
## Hello1
Hello1 is my first iteration of "Hello, World!" in brainf***. It uses raw adjustment of the bytes to equal the ascii codes of the letters and characters.
## Hello2
Hello2 is my first iteration of "Hello, World!" in brainf***. It uses more refined loops and individual bytes for each letter.
## Hello3
Hello3 is my first iteration of "Hello, World!" in brainf***. It refines the process down to 5 bytes (I think). It just moves values around for 4 bytes and has 1 extra counter byte.
